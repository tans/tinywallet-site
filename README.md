# Tinywallet  - Connect web2 and web3

https://tinywallet.app

## Features

1. Connect Exists Account System
2. Zero Transactions Fee
3. Token Economic

## How and Why

1. Layer Pocket, we build a pocket layer for the system. so any transactions in the pocket layer do not need to write to Blockchain. no gas fee is required. for example, when a user signup,  we could mint the user some coin or NFT, but no need to write to the blockchain. until the user collects enough coins or sells the NFTS, he could withdraw to his wallet. This could easier for the user to jump into web3.
2. Embed Internal Wallet, users also do not need to keep their privatekey[12 worlds]. the internal wallet makes users to control their wallet with their passwords, and recoverable.
3. Why do we hold wallets and assets for users?  Cause as a brand or company, we should complete the user's experense, and had the responsbility to make product usable for most people not make a product for hacker.
